# Numerical integration on a triangle
This repository is an application that integrates a given function f: RxR -> R on a triangle, dividing it into n^2 triangles.
This function is then used to interpolate any given function on a diamond: |x| + |y| <= 1.

All the comments inside, as well as the documentation is in Polish. Variable names are in English, so the main concept is easily understandable without any Polish langauge knowledge.

This project is a task for Numeric Methods 2 on the [MiNI](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/tikiwiki/) faculty at [WUT](https://www.pw.edu.pl/).
